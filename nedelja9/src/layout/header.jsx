Unfortunately I haven't worked for anyone yet, which is great because that means you get the honour of being my first ever client! You can check out my projects on my GitHub page (linked below!). If you scroll down you get to know me a little bit better: you can see what skills I have aquired so far, as well as some of my other hobbies not realted to programming. Feel free to contact me via my email!</p>
